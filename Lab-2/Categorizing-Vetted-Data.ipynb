We will exploit Spark ML's high-level APIs built on top of DataFrames to create and tune machine learning pipelines. Spark ML Pipelines enable combining multiple algorithms into a single pipeline or workflow. We will utilize Spark ML's feature transformers to convert, modify and scale the features that will be used to develop the machine learning model. Finally, we will evaluate and cross validate our model to demonstrate the process of determining a best fit model and load the results in the database.\n\n### We are using machine learning to try to predict records that a human has not seen or vetted before. We will use these predictions to sort the highest priority records for a human to look at. We will use as a training set for the algorithm fake data that has been vetted by an analyst as high, medium or low.\u00b6\n\n### We will use generated travel data that has been examined for patterns of Human Trafficking from dashDB to do the machine learning.  We loaded this data in lab 1.\n\n",
